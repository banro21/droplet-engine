Welcome to Protocoin's documentation!
=====================================

Welcome to the Protocoin documentation. Protocoin is pure Python implementation of the
Bitcoin protocol parsing and networking. Protocoin doesn't implement the protocol
rules, only the serialization/deserialization procedures and also basic clients to
interact with the Bitcoin P2P network.

.. note:: Protocoin is intended to be used to build clients that will collect statistics
          of the network, but you can also use it to implement a full Bitcoin client.
