Why another Python client ?
===============================================================================
There are many other projects implementing the Bitcoin protocol, but none
of them has a good documentation and the majority of the projects are
very confusing to understand and to reuse/extend in third-party applications.

The aim of Protocoin is to implement a pythonic and well documented framework
that can be used/extended with little or no effort.
